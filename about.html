    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      For over a decade, I've worked to ensure women and girls shape technology for economic benefit - not just consume it. That work reached 100+ countries through Technovation, UN Women, Mozilla, and the U.S. State Department programs.
Now I'm applying that same principle: economic benefit + local control at national scale. The focus is helping countries deploy AI that benefits their citizens and economies.
My background spans computer science, early AI implementation, international development leadership, and policy advisory roles with the UN High-Level Panel, Mozilla, CARE Canada, and ITU.
Recognition includes the University of Calgary's Distinguished Alumni Award for Lifetime Achievement and Woman of Influence by the Silicon Valley Business Journal. Board service includes CARE Canada, Technovation, the Banff Forum, and the Wilson Center's Women in Public Service Project.
The through-line remains constant: technology should create economic independence for individuals, communities, and nations.
